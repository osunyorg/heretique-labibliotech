    <p>Rutger Bregman</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>In Utopia for Realists , Rutger Bregman shows that we can construct a society with visionary ideas that are, in fact, wholly implementable. Every milestone of civilisation - from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy - was once considered a utopian fantasy. New utopian ideas such as universal basic income and a fifteen-hour work week can become reality in our lifetime. <br>https://halldulivre.com/livre/9781408893210-utopia-for-realists-and-how-we-can-get-there-rutger-bregman/</p>
