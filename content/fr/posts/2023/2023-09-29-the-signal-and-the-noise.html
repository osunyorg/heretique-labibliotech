        <p>Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Overconfidence is often the reason for failure. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.</p>
