        <p>Mr Jones is a drunkard and a lazy farmer. The animals are overworked and underfed. The whole farm is unhappy under his rule. One day, the situation gets out of control and he just has to run for his life : the hungry animals are taking over ! The rules on Animal Farm are simple : No animal shall drink alcohol. No animal shall kill any other animal. All animals are equal.</p>
