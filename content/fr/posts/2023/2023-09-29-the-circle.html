    The Circle
  summary: >-
    <p>Dave Eggers</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world’s most powerful internet company, she feels she’s been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal OS resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. What begins as the captivating story soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge. <br>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/232010/the-circle-by-dave-eggers/</p>
